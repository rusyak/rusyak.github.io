<div>React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, built by top engineers at Facebook. This 8-week program will revolutionize the way you develop user interfaces for your own applications, or for your clients. Read on to learn more about this exciting new workshop, and why you should learn React.js as the next skill on your developer resume.
Facebook’s dev team built React to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time. React lets you express how your app should look at any given point, and can automatically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes. React.js is declarative, which means that React conceptually hits the “refresh” button any time data changes, and knows to only update the changed parts. React was used in-house at Facebook before being released as an open-source project to the public, so you can be certain it knows how to handle an astronomical amount of data.
React is a JavaScript library, but is often mistakenly referred to as a framework. Like many popular frameworks (Bootstrap, for example), React is all about reusable components. However, unlike frameworks, which are built with the goal of getting whole apps up and running quickly, the only thing you do with React is build components. As React.js’s core functionality, components make reusing code, testing, and separating concerns easy.
React was created by Facebook in 2013, and then released as an open-source project. This means that Facebook’s developers solved React’s major problems first, and then made the code available to the world. React.js is, for most developers, clean and easy to use right from the start.
React.js is the 5th most starred JavaScript library on Github, falling just behind Angular, D3, jQuery, and HTML5. It’s popularity is strong with plenty of room to grow. What does that mean to a junior developer? Learn React for lots of job opportunities!</div>
